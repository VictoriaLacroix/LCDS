Some of the many things that could be done
==========================================

* Hard-coding paths in `gen_slides.pl` is a dumb thing to do. But hey, I wrote
  this for me and my server.
* Would be nice to be able to automatically generate slides based on some text
  rather than forcing users to generate images that are nothing more than text
  on a standard background.
